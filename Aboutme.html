    <p class="aboutmecolor">I was born on the Philippines on Semtember 18, 1996. I loved drawing
      ever since I was little due to my older sister introducing me to Japanese animation. I aspired
      to become a illustrator back when I was young. Since then, I been drawing and drawing until I
      got to the point I am now. The reason I have chosen to become a graphic designer in CSU East Bay
      was that so I can get more income and work with new ideas that I can use for my illustrations.
